This is a simple smtp server which only parses the stream looking
for correct protocol handling. It accepts any email address or
message and throws them away (it makes no attempt to deliver mail).

What's the point? I wanted an SMTP server my students could connect
to that I controlled but did not have consequences. And, I wanted
an excuse to learn rust.
